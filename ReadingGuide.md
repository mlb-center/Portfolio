## 3. Document Purpose
This document will describe all the professional products I have made during the semester and to what extend the products contribute to an specific learning outcome. At the end you will find a compact scheme of which products contribute to which learning outcome and a scheme where I show where I think my skills currently compare with the learning outcomes

## 4. Introduction
In this chapter I will give an short introduction of who I am and what knowledge and experience I have related to (enterprise) software engineering so far. Further I will express my goals and interest plus what I expect/hope to learn this semester

### Whoami (Yes that's unix)
My name is Ruben Leerentveld, student Software Engineering and parttime Lead Software Engineer at Netwerk-C. I started this study at Fontys without any knowledge on software engineering or development at all. Over the past 3 years (especially last year) I developed myself intensively in this field.

### Experience last year (briefly)
Spring 2021 I did an internship at Netwerk-C. I started with basic knowledge on api's and basic frontend skills. During this internship my supervisor really threw me in the deep end. I had to build a complete enterprise system in these 5 months. After this intense internship I landed my first job as Lead Software Engineer at Netwerk-C. After summer I did a minor Spanish Language & Culture for 16 hours a week, and 16 hours a week I worked as Software Engineer. 

### Goals
I have clear goals for the upcomming 3 years. First I want to pass this semester the best way possible. My semester always were on the edge but last year I gained so much knowledge that I am more than sure I can complete this semester with flying colours. After this semester I will be doing my graduation internship. I have set my sighs on ASML (I'm in the middle of my application as we speak)

After graduation I will be doing a pre-master at the TU Eindhoven and Fall 2023 I will start a master study in Cyber Security OR Software Engineering (I think the combination of BSc Software Engineering and MSc Cyber Security is a wnated combination)
