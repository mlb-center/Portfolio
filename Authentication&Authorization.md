## 3. Document Purpose
For the learning outcome "Security by design" I had already researched the OWASP top 10 and used Google Authentication.
To raise this learning outcome to an ```Proficient``` I have to implement role based authorization.


## 4. Introduction
I built authentication and authorization on my api with the Spring boot security framework. 
When a user logs in he will receive a cookie in his browser. He is now able to use controllers that are available for his role.
