## 3. Document Purpose
This document will describe all the professional products I have made during the semester and to what extend the products contribute to an specific learning outcome. At the end you will find a compact scheme of which products contribute to which learning outcome and a scheme where I show where I think my skills currently compare with the learning outcomes

## 4. Introduction
In this chapter I will give an short introduction of who I am and what knowledge and experience I have related to (enterprise) software engineering so far. Further I will express my goals and interest plus what I expect/hope to learn this semester

### Whoami (Yes that's unix)
My name is Ruben Leerentveld, student Software Engineering and parttime Lead Software Engineer at Netwerk-C. I started this study at Fontys without any knowledge on software engineering or development at all. Over the past 3 years (especially last year) I developed myself intensively in this field.

### Experience last year (briefly)
Spring 2021 I did an internship at Netwerk-C. I started with basic knowledge on api's and basic frontend skills. During this internship my supervisor really threw me in the deep end. I had to build a complete enterprise system in these 5 months. After this intense internship I landed my first job as Lead Software Engineer at Netwerk-C. After summer I did a minor Spanish Language & Culture for 16 hours a week, and 16 hours a week I worked as Software Engineer. 

### Goals
I have clear goals for the upcomming 3 years. First I want to pass this semester the best way possible. My semester always were on the edge but last year I gained so much knowledge that I am more than sure I can complete this semester with flying colours. After this semester I will be doing my graduation internship. I have set my sighs on ASML (I'm in the middle of my application as we speak)

After graduation I will be doing a pre-master at the TU Eindhoven and Fall 2023 I will start a master study in Cyber Security OR Software Engineering (I think the combination of BSc Software Engineering and MSc Cyber Security is a wnated combination)

## 5. Experience

I started my Fontys career without any knowledge on softwsare engineering or development at all. In the first year I learned how I can program in C#, how to use databases and how I can build websites. With this combined I learned how to use ASP.net as well. The second year I deepened my knowlege in API's, research and the basics of enterprise. The third year really launched my knowledge to a high level

This 3rd year I started my internship at Netwerk-C where I had to build an enterprise e-commerce system. This is where I learned enterprise software on a wide scale

I built:
- Several mature API's
- A webshop frontend (for testing purposes)
- Message queueing with RabbitMQ
- Connection with 3rd party payment provider (Adyen)
- Connection with 3rd party packet service api (PostNL)
- Monitoring & Alerting (With Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana)
- Powershell scripting

The best thing about my internship was the huge overlap between software and networking. The internship company gave me 10 servers I was abla to use and from there built the whole system from scratch! And from scratch I mean: Installing the server blade in the server rack and configure it myself!

After my internship I landed my first job as Lead Software Engineer at Netwerk-C. Ever since I am responsible for all development projects within Netwerk-C. I plan, manage and build projects with input of colleagues. Day (and sometimes night) I work together with my colleagues to satisfy big customers and thrive future for our company


## 6. Deliverables
## 7. Learning outcomes and product matrix
## 8. Skill Level - Self Reflection
In this chapter I reflect on my own skill levels. Underneath is a table with the given learning outcomes plotted against what skill level i think i have myself on that outcome. Under de table you will find a briefly described explaination per learning outcome

### LO1 Developing and Deployment of Enterprise Software as a Professional ```Orienting```

### LO2 Context Based Research ```Orienting```
I started doing research on Docker for my personal project, and integration patterns for the group project

### LO3 Preparation for Life-Long Learning ```Beginning```
Since my teachers in the second semester did not gave me much of an input I started doing Udemy courses in my free time. This semester I am currently doing an Docker - Swarm - Kubernetes course. I do have experience in these field, but professional explaination won't hurt. This way I am able to show that I can learn the rest of my carreer, by my self

### LO4 Scalable Architectures ```Beginning```
In my architecture I took scalability into account. Now in the development I hosted a RabbitMQ server and made the first call to the RabbitMQ server. 

### LO5 Development and Operations (DevOps) ```Beginning```
I do have experience building pipelines with Jenkins. This semester I want to explore new field so I started using GitHub actions!
For the main endpoint api I setup a Ci/Cd pipeline thats lints my code on every push (code check) and whenever I push to the master branch the pipeline will build an docker image and push it to DockerHub

### LO6 Cloud Services ```Beginning ```
For this learning outcome a build server at home which I hosted docker on. In Docker containers I am hosting all parts of the system. Together with the Docker course I am exploring this learning otucome.

### LO7 Security By Design ```Beginning```
I do have experience in security. I did the specialisation cyber security at Fontys and followed the "Certified Ethical Hacking Course" + Exam given by George Dobrea.
6th of April I followed the workshop about security and then started hacking into the Juice Shop website.

### LO8 Distributed Data ```Orienting```
As a group we followed the Ethical workshop hosted by Nicole


## 9. Skill Level - Teacher Review
In this chapter you can check up on the history of teacher reviews on my skill levels (@) and how they compare to my own reflection at that moment in time (#). Under each table you can find a brief description of the teacher's review as well

### (#) Self Reflection
### (@) Teacher Reflection
### (@#) Teacher and student agree on reflection
