## 3. Document Purpose
In this document you will find my exeriences building a monitoring cluster with Telegraf, InfluxDB and Grafana.

## 4. Introduction
Earlier in the project I configured a RabbitMQ server that handles requests.
In a presentation hosted by Merel I learned that validation is the way to go from a "Beginning" to "Proficient" in my learning outcomes.
RabbitMQ is an important part of my system setup. In order to ensure functionality, availability and performance I built a monitoring cluster with Telegraf, InfluxDB and Grafana.
